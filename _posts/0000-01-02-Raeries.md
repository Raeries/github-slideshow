# My Thoughts

## RE: Introduction to GitHub 

https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github

So far this Lesson mostly makes sense. My feedback would be to have a "Prerequisite" or "Setup" section to detail what is needed to proceed more smoothly.

### Example:

1. **Download and Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).** 
*(To me this was not immediately obvious; I originally thought this would be all online with no need to install anything. I realize that local vs. remote concepts are common for source control repositories.)*

2. **Setup [commit email addresses](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address).** For Git user configuration and Github settings with privacy preferences in mind.
*(To me this would have went smoother if I did not run into email setting troubles in the middle of the lesson)*
